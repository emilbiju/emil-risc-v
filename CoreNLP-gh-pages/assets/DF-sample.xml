Yesterday afternoon as I negotiated route 149 from Lake George to Fort Ann in NY I passed a new diner that had opened that day. I didnt notice the name but out side it had a Union Jack and a St Georges flag flying
I wonder if they serve proper 'English' food, served by proper 'English' people ? I may have to check it out asap <img src="http://britishexpats.com/forum/images/smilies/wink.gif"/>
